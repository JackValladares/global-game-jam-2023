This is a game called Treeversal that was built over the course of two days for the Global. The game is a 3D game on a 2-dimensional plane, and the goal is to guide 'Plant Guy' through the level by interacting with various objects as he walks

I handled the physics, environment, and general gameplay programming, whereas the rest of the team did UI work, art, animation, and storyboarding/ideas
